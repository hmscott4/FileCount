# Network File Share MP
This management pack monitors network files shares that are hosted on Windows or non-Windows servers.  Network File Shares are monitored from designated Watcher Nodes (Windows Computers with a monitoring agent). The management pack may be configured to monitor for file counts or aggregate file size.  

Discovery of Network File Shares is done using a configuration file.

Based on original work from RealDolmen.

See the management pack guide for additional documentation.
